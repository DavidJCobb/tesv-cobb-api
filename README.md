CobbAPI: A script-extending resource for Skyrim Classic mod authors.

As of December 3rd, it's more-or-less release-ready, but I want to set up "friendlier" documentation first. I also have plans to add features to another mod that will use CobbAPI if it's installed, and I should probably do that before releasing CobbAPI so I have a real-world test.

Soon, though! Soon.
