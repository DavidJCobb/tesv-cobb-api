# tesv-cobb-api
CobbAPI: A script-extending resource for Skyrim Classic mod authors.

As of December 31th, it's more-or-less release-ready, but I need to make a demo (my MCM-based test suite will work). I'm also working on a Cobb Positioner feature that uses CobbAPI, and this has been an invaluable way to test things even further.

Soon, though! Soon.
