CobbAPI: A script-extending resource for Skyrim Classic mod authors.

I place no limitations on using anything from the "ReverseEngineered" folder; that folder's contents describe classes and data reverse-engineered from the 2011 release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I can't reasonably claim overship over that content, and don't wish to prevent anyone from making use of my discoveries in any case.

The finished work is available for download [from NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95546).
