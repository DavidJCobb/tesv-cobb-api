   // IFORM
   //
   // Interface for forms; the base type used for heavy-userdata that serve 
   // as wrappers for passing TESForm pointers to Lua. It can and should be 
   // subclassed for different form types, and there are some facilities 
   // built-in to allow for form types whose forms can be unloaded or deleted 
   // from memory during Skyrim's normal operation.
   //
   // WHEN DEFINING SUBCLASSES, YOU SHOULD:
   // 
   //  - Have your subclass inherit from IForm.
   //
   //     - If your subclass represents a form type that is always in memory, 
   //       then define its constructor as so:
   //
   //          YourSubclassHere(TESForm* f) : IForm(f) {};
   //
   //     - If your subclass represents a form type that can be unloaded or 
   //       deleted, then you should manually define a constructor that calls 
   //       TESForm's private constructor, passing true as the boolean, e.g.
   //
   //          YourSubclassHere(TESForm* f) : IForm(f, true) {};
   //
   //       If only some forms of your subclass can be unloaded, then you can 
   //       pass that condition as your boolean. For example, only actor-bases 
   //       that were created at run-time (0xFF load order index) can be deleted, 
   //       so IActorBase passes the result of a form ID check as the boolean.
   //
   //       Typically, wrappers for form types that can unload will contain 
   //       extra information that can be used to relocate the wrapped form, in 
   //       the case that it is unloaded and later reloaded. For example, a 
   //       wrapper for TESObjectREFR should store the reference form ID, while 
   //       a wrapper for an exterior TESObjectCELL should store the grid coord-
   //       inates and parent TESWorldSpace of the cell. You'll want to be doing 
   //       this in the constructor.
   //
   //  - Have your subclass override signature().
   //
   //     - If your subclass represents a form that can be unloaded or deleted 
   //       at run-time, then you must also override resolve(), abandon(), and 
   //       possibly ruleOutForm(...).
   //
   //       The general strategy for these form types is to store "directions to 
   //       the form" alongside the wrapped form pointer. Whenever Lua code isn't 
   //       running, we set the pointer to nullptr via IForm::abandon; the next 
   //       time a Lua script attempts to access the form, we "follow the direct-
   //       ions" to retrieve the form again. If the form has unloaded since the 
   //       last time Lua worked with it, then we'll get nullptr and we know that 
   //       the form is currently unavailable. If the form unloaded and then re-
   //       loaded (such that it's now located at a different address), then 
   //       we'll get the fresh, up-to-date pointer.
   //
   //       As for ruleOutForm(TESForm*)? Well, consider this case: we get a 
   //       wrapper for a created reference -- a TESObjectREFR with an 0xFF 
   //       load order index. The reference is later deleted, and the form ID 
   //       is reused for another reference. Then, Lua attempts to access the 
   //       new reference. Well, we already have a wrapper for that form ID... 
   //       How would we be able to tell that that wrapper is for a different 
   //       form? Well, every reference gets a unique(ish) handle, separate 
   //       from the form ID, so what if we also stored the reference handle? 
   //       And what if the "reuse existing wrappers" code could pass the new 
   //       reference to some function on the existing wrapper, which could 
   //       then compare the reference handles? Thus, ruleOutForm(TESForm*).
   //
   //       ruleOutForm should return true if the argument CANNOT BE the form 
   //       that the wrapper was originally created for.
   //
   //       Note that ruleOutForm is only relevant for forms that can be 
   //       created and deleted, since those are the only ones that should be 
   //       able to end up sharing formTypes and formIDs at run-time. Of course, 
   //       in practice, I think every form type that can be created can also be 
   //       deleted.
   // 
   //  - Have your subclass create its metatable similarly to IForm, but passing 
   //    IForm::metatableName as the superclass name.
   //
   //  - After creating the metatable, map it to its form type by way of a call 
   //    to IForm::mapFormTypeToMetatable. This will ensure that anything that 
   //    returns a form to Lua (by way of IForm::make) will use your subclass 
   //    if the form is of your subclass's form type.
   //
   //  - Map the subclass itself to its form type using mapFormTypeToFactory. 
   //    The factory argument should be formWrapperFactory<YourSubclassHere>.
   //
   // WHEN DEFINING MEMBER FUNCTIONS ON A SUBCLASS, YOU SHOULD:
   //
   //  - Begin them with this code:
   // 
   //       YourSubclassHere* wrapper = YourSubclassHere::fromStack(L);
   //       luaL_argcheck(L, wrapper != nullptr, 1, "'YourSubclassHere' expected");
   //       auto form = wrapper->unwrap();
   //
   //  - Check whether the form is nullptr.
   //
   // THINGS TO NOTE:
   //
   //  - Because we're mapping subclasses to form types, things can get a little 
   //    weird. Suppose you define a subclass for TESObjectREFR, but no subclass 
   //    for Actor. If Lua attempts to return an Actor, then it will use the IForm 
   //    wrapper, not the IReference wrapper, because IReference only maps to the 
   //    form type for TESObjectREFR and not the form type for Actor.
   //
   // TODO:
   //
   //  - We should have a singleton, _G["skyrim"], for the majority of game API 
   //    functions (e.g. "getFormByID"). Inside this singleton, we should have 
   //    one singleton for each form interface (e.g. skyrim.IForm); these form 
   //    interface singletons could hold useful methods (e.g. "for each form of 
   //    this type") and constants (e.g. IActorBase.GENDER_MALE = 0).
   //
   //  - If we hook the game's reference-delete event, then we don't need to 
   //    guard against new references reusing the form IDs of old references. 
   //    Likewise if we hook every gameplay-related deletion of other created 
   //    forms.
   //
   //     - REFR deletion is hooked; PACK and NPC_ deletion is not.
   //
   //     - If we do this for every form type that needs it, then we can ditch 
   //       IForm::ruleOutForm entirely. That function was literally only made 
   //       available as a means of guarding against form ID reuse. If we ditch 
   //       that function, then we need to amend the documentation comments 
   //       above.
   //
   //        - IReference uses it; we can probably remove it from that class.

   //
   // Here's the approach that needs to be taken for providing access to forms to Lua 
   // scripts:
   //
   // First, we need to define the Lua-side wrapper. When we return a form, we will 
   // return it as a "heavy userdata:" a piece of arbitrary C data which is managed 
   // by the Lua VM, and which (for the script side of things) has a metatable that 
   // we define and provide. For forms, the C data will simply be a pointer, and the 
   // metatable will be what provides our various member functions; we'll create the 
   // metatable in C.
   //
   // To create an instance of heavy userdata at the top of the Lua stack, we call:
   //
   //    lua_newuserdata  (lua_state, size_of_c_data_in_bytes)
   //    luaL_getmetatable(lua_state, "name_with_which_the_metatable_was_registered");
   //    lua_setmetatable (lua_state, -2);
   //
   // There is one slight problem with that, however: if we run that code every time 
   // we wish to return a form, then we can end up creating duplicate heavy userdatas 
   // for the same form. To work around this, we create a list of existing wrappers 
   // for forms. Specifically:
   //
   //  - We create a "weak table," analogous to a JavaScript WeakMap, and store it on 
   //    the "Lua registry." The registry is sort of like a global scope, but... more.
   //
   //  - The keys to this weakmap will be raw form pointers (which we offer to Lua in 
   //    the form of "light userdata"). The values will be heavy userdata.
   //
   //  - When it's time to return a form, we look it up in the weakmap. We return a 
   //    preexisting heavy userdata if there is one, or create, store, and return a 
   //    new one otherwise.
   //
   // What is a light userdata? Well, it's literally just a C pointer. Light userdata 
   // have value semantics -- akin to numbers, strings, and booleans -- while heavy 
   // userdata have table semantics, with the ability to define metatables and the 
   // like. This means that our weakmap can exist purely as a Lua construct.
   //
   // There's one wrinkle: if we're reusing heavy userdata for forms, then what's to 
   // stop one script from overriding member functions on a form's wrapper in order 
   // to mess with other scripts? Well, heavy userdata have "table semantics," but 
   // they aren't actual tables. They can't store key/value pairs, so rawget and 
   // rawset don't affect them; only their metatables can have data.
   //
