Scriptname CobbAPIDetection Hidden

; The DetectionInterceptService allows you to tamper with the detection of any 
; actor. You can flag an actor as being unable to detect other actors, or flag 
; the actor as undetectable to other actors.
;
; The service works by exchanging "handles." When you flag an actor, you receive 
; an integer "handle." To unflag the actor, you must pass that handle back in. 
; This ensures that if multiple scripts are acting on the same actor, they do 
; not conflict: instead, their effects overlap.
;
; Negative handles are invalid and indicate that the actor could not be added.
;
; In addition to using handles, you can associate an optional string "tag" with 
; any given change. You can also forcibly unflag all handles associated with a 
; given tag. This is useful for uninstallation scripts and last-resort fixups.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; In order to offer this functionality, CobbAPI has to patch a particular part 
; of Skyrim's code in-memory. If the patch site has already been patched by 
; another mod, such as my ESO Death and Resurrection, then CobbAPI will defer 
; to that other mod: the DetectionInterceptService will not function, and you 
; will not be able to add new registrations.
;
; Use the ServiceIsAvailable method to check whether the service is online.
