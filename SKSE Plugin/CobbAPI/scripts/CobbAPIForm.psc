Int[] Function GetBounds      (Form akSubject) Global Native ; Returns the OBND data (pre-generated by the Creation Kit's "Recalc Bounds" function) in this format: [ iMinX, iMinY, iMinZ, iMaxX, iMaxY, iMaxZ ].
Bool  Function IsDefiniteItem (Form akSubject) Global Native ; Returns true if the form is a "definite" item, i.e. not a LeveledItem, a Light that isn't carryable, or a COBJ.

; Most form types don't actually load their editor IDs in-game. CobbAPI patches

;
; This function can retrieve editor IDs for forms that normally load them, and 
; for forms that are induced to load them by CobbAPI.
