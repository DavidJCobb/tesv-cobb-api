;    AN OVERVIEW OF HOW COMPUTERS STORE TEXT
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; In order to avoid ambiguity, I would prefer to document things using the most precise 
; terminology possible, but much of this terminology isn't known to people who don't 
; explicitly do "hard" text programming. I had to do some learning myself in order to 
; offer as much functionality as I wanted to. As such, here's a "brief" primer on how 
; computers store text.
;
; Computers can only work with numeric data, so every symbol that a piece of text may 
; contain must be represented using a number, or "code point." The oldest surviving sys-
; tem for this is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which was 
; introduced in 1963. In this system, every single glyph is represented with a single 
; byte, and so up to 256 glyphs (including a string terminator and other control codes) 
; can be represented. ASCII only defined 128 glyphs, all focused on English text, leav-
; ing the last 128 glyphs undefined.
;
; As such, non-English text could only be represented in alternate encodings. Because 
; virtually all programming is done in English, these encodings are typically supersets 
; of ASCII. For languages that have large numbers of glyphs, such as Chinese, Japanese, 
; Korean, and Vietnamese, these encodings often have to use multiple bytes for some or 
; all glyphs.
;
; In 1991, the Unicode standard was published. It uses multiple bytes for all glyphs in 
; order to maximize its coverage and support as many languages and scripts as possible, 
; but there are alternate encodings (such as UTF-8) that are designed to compress Uni-
; code text whenever possible, with a focus on representing ASCII as compactly as poss-
; ible (given that markup and program code, invisible to a user, will be in ASCII).
;
; Unicode has nuances that are largely invisible to native English-speaking program-
; mers, who won't encounter or have to work with foreign-language text unless they put 
; themselves in situations where they may encounter it. Native English-speaking program-
; mers are used to the assumptions that one glyph will be represented one way using one 
; byte, and all of those assumptions fall apart when using Unicode and UTF-8.
;
; A single glyph can be represented using multiple code point sequences: Unicode offers 
; better ways of representing glyphs that have diacritics, but it also retains older 
; representations for backward compatibility's sake. Moreover, a single code point will 
; be multiple bytes in Unicode; in UTF-8, ASCII code points are single-byte while all 
; other code points are multi-byte (with higher code points requiring more bytes).
;
; The string functions offered by CobbAPI are Unicode-aware, and the documentation will 
; reflect this: string lengths, character comparisons, and more are done on the basis of 
; code points, not glyphs or bytes.

;    STRING HANDLING IN SKYRIM'S SCRIPT ENGINE
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; When Papyrus strings are written to ESP and ESM files, they are always written in 
; UTF-8, regardless of the language in use by a mod author's system. I assume that UTF-8 
; is also used for Papyrus strings at run-time. (I'm not sure what would happen to string 
; constants in a script, though; does the Papyrus Compiler treat all files as UTF-8?)
;
; These script functions generally use UTF-8.
;
; It's worth noting that non-Papyrus strings are not guaranteed to use UTF-8. In Skyrim 
; Classic, the text encoding used by the rest of the game varies from language to lang-
; uage. Worse, ESP and ESM files don't contain any metadata identifying their language 
; or their encoding. As such, Papyrus functions that pull strings from game data (such 
; as getters for editor IDs and actors' names) will generally return data in an unknown 
; encoding, which may or may not be UTF-8.
;
; Papyrus strings are stored case-insensitively according to the C/POSIX locale (which 
; determines what characters are considered "letters" with uppercase and lowercase 
; forms). As such, the following glyphs, and only the following glyphs, are considered 
; interchangeable:
;
;           Uppercase | A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
;          -----------+-----------------------------------------------------
;           Lowercase | a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
;
; The game handles case-insensitivity byte by byte, so an accented letter will be handled 
; differently depending on whether it is a single code point or two (a non-accented 
; letter followed by an accent diacritic).
;
; If you specify two different strings that are identical save for case, the game will 
; use the first variant to load. The catch is that this applies across most or all of the 
; game engine, not just within Papyrus. In an English game, it is impossible to set a 
; Papyrus string variable to "dog" because there is already an in-game Race form named 
; "Dog", and so "Dog" was the first variant of the string to load. Similarly, trying to 
; set a string to "oBjEcTreferenCE" will always yield "ObjectReference" instead.
;

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;    NUMBERS
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; The functions for converting strings to numbers do not allow separators (e.g. decimal 
; points or commas). They search for the first numeric byte, and then keep reading until 
; they encounter any non-numeric byte.

;    COMPARISONS
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Sorting as a concept gets extremely complicated once you go international. For example, 
; the possible "alphabetical" sort orders for Chinese characters include: stroke count 
; (which varies between traditional and simplified Chinese); Pinyin alphabetical order; 
; and a UTF-8-defined sort order that (I'm told) most Chinese speakers dislike. The sort 
; orders for Japanese and Korean differ even when they use the same glyphs.
;
; I don't want to define just one "natural sort" function that will always work one way,
; and preclude the possibility of implementing internationalized sort orders down the 
; road. My compromise is to suffix any sort function with the name of the characters it 
; supports.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; The difference between a "natural" or alphabetical sort, and an ASCIIbetical sort, are 
; as follows:
;
; ASCIIbetical | Alphabetical
; z1           | z1
; z10          | z2
; z11          | z3
; z12          | z4
; z13          | z5

; Functions for sorting arrays come in a few variants: a function that sorts just the 
; string array; and a function that sorts a second array passed beside it. The akStrings 
; array is not modified (a copy is returned), but the axSecond array is modified in-place. 
; One use for this would be sorting an array of EditorIDs consistently with a matching 
; array of FormIDs (or forms themselves).

;    REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; C++ standard regexes use ECMAScript (JavaScript) style.
;
; Papyrus treats strings case-insensitively and uses the earliest defined string. This has 
; a few implications that make regexes somewhat impractical. Regex character codes remain 
; case-sensitive, but Papyrus doesn't maintain their case. This means that if one mod wants 
; to use "\w" and another wants to use "\W", each mod will end up using the same regex 
; (generally whichever was defined first).
;
; We work around this by requiring you to specify a "case sentinel," which is a string that 
; has the same number of characters as your input string, but consists entirely of the '0' 
; and '1' glyphs. Any character that should be lowercase in the regex should be a '0' in the 
; case string; characters that should be uppercase in the regex should be '1' in the case 
; string. Characters that aren't letters (see explanation at the top of this file) can be 
; represented in the case sentinel with any glyph.
;
; For the purposes of the case sentinel, a "character" is one code point, as opposed to 
; bytes or visible glyphs. (Bytes would require, say, a Chinese regex character to have 
; three case sentinel characters. Visible glyphs would be more intuitive when diacritics 
; enter the picture, but are far harder to code.)
;
; Also, because all strings are case-insensitive, regexes are always executed case-insensi-
; tively.
