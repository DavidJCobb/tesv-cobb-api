; NOTE: We don't check for negative lengths, indices, etc., in your arguments. The whole point of these 
; APIs is to run at least as fast as doing things "the vanilla way," so I'm reluctant to waste even the 
; imperceptibly-small amount of speed that two assembly opcodes would waste. Expect things to break if 
; you pass in negative numbers for lengths, counts, start indices, and so on. If your code is running 
; in a context where those values could ever make it to these functions to begin with, it's on you to 
; check for them and normalize them however your use case requires.
;
; To wit, these methods will frequently interpret -100 as 4294967196.
;
; To clarify: you can have negative numbers IN YOUR ARRAYS. Just don't pass the numbers themselves as 
; arguments to these functions.
