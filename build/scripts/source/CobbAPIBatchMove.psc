; 2 = Move the reference back to its editor location

Function SetAlsoMoveTeleportMarkers (Int aiHandle, Int aiWhich) Global Native ; 0 by default; if set to 1 and you move load doors, we will also move the matching teleport marker to keep it in the same spot relative to the door; if set to 2, we maintain the marker's offset from the door's editor position
