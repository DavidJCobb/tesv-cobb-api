; If abDoFullProcessing is True, then this works exactly like TCL (except that it only runs if we aren't 
; already in the state you want); however, the "full processing" in question can cause major performance 
; hitches and abnormal actor behavior (this is an issue with the base game). If abDoFullProcessing is False, 
; then we skip that processing and just modify the player's collision state; this works just fine and 
; doesn't seem to cause performance and behavior issues, but I don't know what the consequences of skipping 
; full processing might be.

; update to their last-known position, then the position getter returns an empty array.
