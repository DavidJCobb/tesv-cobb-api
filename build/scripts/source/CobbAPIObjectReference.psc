;
; Collision Primitives
;
;  - These methods can add and modify collision-primitive data on placed references.
;
;  - You can only add collision primitive boxes to references whose base forms: are Activators; and have 
;    the injected keyword with form ID 0x00C0BB03.
;
;  - I'm still not clear on *when* the game actually generates collision data for these references. They 
;    must currently have 3D loaded, so perhaps the data is generated or updated when the reference moves, 
;    or during the process that generates 3D.
;
;  - The NAVCUT layer is 49.

;  - Entry points: [front, behind, right, left, up]
;  - Marker types: {0 = Lean, 1 = Sit, 2 = Sleep}
;
; The game engine supports up to 24 furniture markers on a FURN. If a 3D model defines more 
; than this many markers, our "All" getters will only return data for the 0th through 23rd 
; markers.
;
; Note also that a furniture marker can be "enabled" yet still have all of its entry points 
; disabled, rendering it unusable. GetFurnitureEnabledMarkers will recognize it as enabled.

Float[]         Function GetTeleportMarkerCoordinates        (ObjectReference akSubject) Global Native ; NOTE: Teleport markers are "backwards." Given linked doors A and B, Door A's teleport marker is the one that exists in front of Door B, and vice versa.

That offset will be applied to the reference's current location, and the marker will be moved to the resulting coordinates.

Float[]           Function GetHeadingOffsetPosition (ObjectReference akSubject, Float afHeading) Global Native ; Given a ref and the player's yaw-angle, where would we have to move the player to get them looking directly at the ref, near the ref, without being trapped inside the ref?
Int               Function GetMotionType            (ObjectReference akSubject) Global Native ; Return values correspond to those used in SetMotionType. 0 means there is no collision or there is no 3D. -1 means that different motion types are in use within the 3D model.

Bool              Function IsCleanlyMovable         (ObjectReference akSubject) Global Native ; If this function returns false, then the reference is movable, but changes to its position will "bleed" across savefile loads.
