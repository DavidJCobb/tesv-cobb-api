      Miscellaneous functions for "deep" scripting tasks, like checking whether a Papyrus

               This method returns True if <var>akPointer</var> is non-null, or False otherwise. 
               In a limited number of edge-cases, this can be distinct from <var>akPointer</var> 
               being None.

               In order to understand this method's utility, we must discuss the script engine 
               using terms introduced in Fallout 4. Every running script instance is what 
               Fallout 4 calls a "ScriptObject," and ScriptObjects "wrap" pointers to game 
               engine objects such as <code>TESForm</code> or <code>TESObjectREFR</code>. 
               Papyrus data, such as variables and properties, exists on the ScriptObject. If 
               you pass the ScriptObject to a native method, the method receives the "wrapped 
               pointer," i.e. the raw <code>TESForm*</code> or <code>TESObjectREFR*</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
               In rare cases, it's possible for a game engine object to disappear out from under 
               a ScriptObject. This is the cause of Papyrus warnings about calling functions on 
               None objects, with stack traces indicating that the functions were called on 
               NULL. ScriptObjects exist semi-independently of the wrapped pointers and can 
               sometimes try to act on those wrapped pointers even after they've gone null. 
               Strangely, these script objects test as <code>!= None</code>, so you have no way 
               to check for this in a script.
            </p>
            <p>
               For ActiveMagicEffect scripts, this can occur if you try to dispel the effect 
               during its OnEffectFinish handler.

            Returns coordinates representing a good place to spawn an object, such that it is

               Given an object with bounds <var>afBounds</var>, and the player's coordinates as 
               <var>afPlayerCoordinates</var>, this function computes a good place to spawn that 
               object such that it will be in the player's view and at a comfortable distance. 
               The function returns those coordinates. The math involved takes into account the 
               player's rotation and the bounds size, although especially-off-center bounds may 
               foul up the calculation.
