      When an actor makes a noise, it creates a <dfn>detection event</dfn>. Each detection 
      event is a piece of data stored on the noisemaking actor's AI process; detection 
      events have a sound level, a position, and an age. Events last for a limited amount 
      of time (configurable as the GameSetting <var>fDetectionEventExpireTime</var>) 
      before they are deleted; these events are what allow other actors to hear the 
      noisemaking actor.
   </p>
   <p>
      An actor can only have one detection event at a time; the ongoing event is stored 
      in their AI data. This means, among other things, that forcibly disabling an 
      actor's AI will also terminate their detection event.
