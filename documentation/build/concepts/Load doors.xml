      In Skyrim, a pair of <dfn>load doors</dfn> is essentially a pair of doors that, 
      when activated, behave like teleporters, with each door teleporting the player 
      or an actor to the other. Appropriately, each load door has a <dfn>teleport 
      marker</dfn> that determines where the player ends up.
   </p>
   <p>
      Somewhat confusingly, teleport markers are opposite-paired. If you have a load 
      door in Whiterun that connects to a load door in Riften, then the Whiterun load 
      door's teleport marker is in Riften, and the Riften load door's teleport marker 
      is in Whiterun. To make our documentation clearer, we refer to the <dfn>near 
      teleport marker</dfn> and the <dfn>far teleport marker</dfn> when describing 
      situations where a teleport marker is operated on. For our hypothetical Whiterun 
      door, the near marker would be the one in Whiterun, and the far marker would be 
      the one in Riften.
